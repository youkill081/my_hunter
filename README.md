# my_hunter

**Epitech project**

__Subject :__
My_hunter was the first graphical project of the year, we had to code it in C and use the CSFML.

The subject was very open the reflection.

The rules are simple, you have to survive as much time as possible by killing all duck before they not reach the right of the screen.
Killing them are simple too, you only have to shoot them by clicking on it. But you have only tree bullets, to reload you have to press the 'r' key and a word appear on the screen. You must write this word and it's reloaded :)

__Usage :__
./my_hunter
